# .sharc

My toolbox for easy management and growth of bash aliases/functions.

##Installation:
1) Clone the repo to your favorite location. I assume that is $HOME.
2) Append the following code to your bashrc:
```bash
##source portable aliases
export MottoColor=$(tput setaf 2) # Green
source $HOME/.sharc/.sharc
```
